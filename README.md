# Watchlist
A movie watchlist app using AngularJS

## Introduction
The app lets you search for movies on themoviedb.org and add them for future reference. It also lets you browse through the top 15 featured titles on themoviedb.org, with a slideshow of the top 7 movie backdrop on the very top of the page. 

##How to use  
* Download the project and host the folder on a local server. An easy way to do that would be to download the chrome extension called Web Server from :  
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog  
* Open Web Server and select the project folder that you just cloned. Open the link shown and select `index.html`.  
* Type in the name of a movie in the Search box and press Enter, and you should see a list of search results appear on the right side of the screen. Click on 'Add to Watchlist' in order to add that title to wishlist. You cannot add a title more than once.  
* Click on Wishlist in the side navbar to view and manage the titles added to wishlist.  
* Click on Featured to see the latest in Hollywood. The posters of the top 5 trending movies are shown as a slideshow.
* The "History" option is currently disabled. I hope to fix that soon.

##Bugs:  
* Wishlist is erased when page is refreshed or browser is closed.  
* No option to add to wishlist in the Featured page.
